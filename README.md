1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

You can write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by writing clean, neat code with clear comments.

2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I approach problems by breaking them down into simple steps. I would say that my approach to this project differed greatly compared to other projects in such that my approach was chaotic for this entire class. I definitely struggled with the material in this course and honestly I'm still lost.

3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

In general, computer scientists use technology to solve problems.
